# 🌍 Climate Change EDA for Policy Insights

## 📌 Overview
This project was developed as part of **DeepData Hack 2.0 – Data Science Hackathon** organized by the *Center of Excellence - AI, School of Engineering & Technology (K.R. Mangalam University)*.  
Our goal was to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on global climate change data and extract **policy-relevant insights** to combat the accelerating risks of climate change.

## 🌐 Problem Statement
Climate change is accelerating – global temperatures are rising, extreme weather events are intensifying, and sea levels are advancing. Policymakers urgently need **data-driven insights** to design impactful interventions.  

**Objective:**  
- Analyze global climate data (2000–2023)  
- Identify patterns, correlations, and risks  
- Translate insights into **actionable climate policies**

## 🛠️ Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning & Validation**  
   - No missing values, duplicates, or outliers  
   - Data types validated  
2. **EDA Approach**  
   - Univariate, bivariate, multivariate, temporal, and geographic analysis  
   - Grouped by Year, Country, and Region  
3. **Correlation & Pattern Discovery**  
   - Explored both linear & non-linear patterns  
   - Focus on policy-relevant insights  

---

## ❓ Key Questions Explored
Our analysis was driven by **15 core EDA questions**, including:  
- How have global temperatures trended across regions?  
- How has global mean sea level rise changed?  
- Which countries face the highest frequency of extreme events?  
- Is renewable energy adoption linked to reduced emissions?  
- Are rainfall declines and deforestation linked to extreme events?  
- Which regions are most vulnerable to sea level rise?  
- Did the Paris Agreement influence emission trends?  

---

## 🔑 Key Insights
1. **Rainfall & Forest Loss Hotspots** → Australia, China, France, India, UK  
2. **Renewable Success Stories** → Germany & UK slowed emissions with renewables  
3. **High-Risk Coastal Nations** → India & Indonesia face extreme events + sea rise  
4. **Population Growth + Forest Loss** → Brazil & South Africa driving higher emissions  
5. **Climate Finance Gap** → Rich countries reduce emissions faster than developing nations

## 🏛️ Policy Recommendations
- 🌳 **Reforestation & Water Management** – restore ecosystems  
- ⚡ **Renewable Energy Subsidies & Mandates** – accelerate clean energy adoption  
- 🏗️ **Resilient Infrastructure & Early Warnings** – protect vulnerable populations  
- 🌲 **Forest Conservation + Sustainable Development** – balance growth with ecology  
- 💰 **Global Climate Finance** – equitable funding for developing nations  

---

## 📈 Tools & Technologies
- **Programming:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- **Dashboard / Presentation:** Streamlit, Power BI / PPT  
- **Version Control:** GitHub  

---

## 🏆 Conclusion
Our analysis confirms **undeniable climate change patterns** demanding urgent policy action.  
Using EDA, we identified critical intervention areas:  
- Renewable Expansion  
- Forest Protection  
- Coastal Resilience  
- Equitable Finance  

**Framework:**  
`Data → Insights → Policy → Action`
